# SkyClient Updater

This is a mod created for [SkyClient](https://github.com/nacrt/SkyblockClient). It updates mods in-game based on a data repository 

Most of the code here was from my own work on [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod)

Additionally, this mod would not be possible without Open Source Software, namely code from Wynntils and ChatShortcuts
